    "This project explores a unique dataset that contains user information on the OKCupid website. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the relationship status of these users based on their information. After cleaning the data and performing feature engineering, we fitted the dataset to a Random Forest Classifier model and evaluated its performance. Fortunately, the model performed really well with the dataset. We also created a pipeline to automate our workflow and make it more efficient for future use. "
